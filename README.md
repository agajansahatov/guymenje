# Guymenje

**Guymenje** is a simple front-end web application built as part of my learning journey while studying front-end development from [Mosh Hamedani's courses](https://codewithmosh.com/). This project was created using modern web development tools including Vite, TypeScript, React, and etc. It's designed to showcase my understanding of building scalable and interactive web applications. It is just a landing page for an imaginary Application Development Company called Guymenje.

## Features

- **Modern Development Stack**: Built with Vite, TypeScript, React, and CSS-in-JS.
- **Responsive Design**: The UI adjusts gracefully to different screen sizes.
- **Interactive User Interface**: Engaging, dynamic components powered by React state and hooks.
- **Optimized for Performance**: Powered by Vite, ensuring fast load times and minimal overhead.
- **Clean and Maintainable Code**: Easy to understand and extend for future development.

## Tech Stack

- **Vite**: A fast, opinionated web bundler and development server.
- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that provides static types and improves code quality.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, using hooks and functional components.
- **CSS-in-JS**: A styling technique where CSS is written inside JavaScript files (using libraries like styled-components or Emotion) for modular, component-based styling.
